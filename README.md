## Description 

LectorScan is a platform designed to provide a seamless and immersive manga reading experience. The platform aims for simplicity in navigation, ensuring users can swiftly access their favorite mangas hassle-free. Our mission is to offer users an extensive collection of mangas to cater to their needs.

User-friendly navigation lies at the heart of the user experience, ensuring users can quickly access their favorite mangas without any fuss.

Furthermore, LectorScan is an evolving platform, continuously improved to offer a visually appealing and engaging site. My goal is to develop this personal project by adding numerous features in the future to showcase my expertise in React.

Currently, LectorScan does not use external APIs but utilizes JSON files to store and display chapter data!
